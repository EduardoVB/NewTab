NEWTABCTL REFERENCE

Introduction:
This control is a further development of SSTabEx project.
It still keeps backward compatibility with SSTab (fully), and mostly with SSTabEx, although some properties have been changed.

This new control introduces the "Flat" style and many related properties.
It also introduces "Themes", that are a set of property settings stored together.
Another thing new is the TDI mode. TDI stands for "Tabbed Document Interface", as an alternative to SDI and MDI.

Other new features are:
CanReorderTabs (property), for allowing tab dragging.
Icons in tabs using icon fonts.

*NewTab control*
- Tabbed control for VB6.
Backward compatible with SSTab (fully), and with SSTabEx (mostly).

Properties: 

AutoRelocateControls property:
	Type: NTAutoRelocateControlsConstants
	Returns or sets a value that determines if the contained controls will be automatically relocated when the tab body changes in size or position.
	
	Values:
	ntRelocateOnTabOrientationChange: The contained controls will be automatically relocated when TabOrientation changes.
	ntRelocateAlways: The contained controls will be automatically relocated when TabOrientation changes and also when the tab space changes in height.
	ntRelocateNever:  The contained controls will never be automatically relocated. Choose this value if you are relocating the controls by code in the Form_Resize or Resize events.


AutoTabHeight property:
	Type: Boolean
	Returns or sets the a value that determines whether the tab height (and value of property TabHeight) is set automatically according to the font (and tab icons (or pictures, in case there are set icons or pictures). Note: it asumes one-liner captions.
	If the property TabHeight is manually set, AutoTabHeight is then set to False.
	For newly added controls, its default it True, but if you are updating from a previous version or an SSTab control, it will be set to False.


BackColor property:
	Type: Long

	When the control is themed, this property value has no effect.


BackColorTabs property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the background color of the tabs, except the active tab that is set by BackColorSelectedTab.

	If Windows Visual Styles are applied (Style = ntStyleWindows), the background of the controls are painted with the background of the themed tab body, so this property has no effect in that case.
	If ChangeControlsBackColor is False, the BackColor of the contained controls is left unchanged.
	If ChangeControlsBackColor is True, and the control is not themed, changing the BackColorSelectedTab propery value will also change the BackColor of the contained controls, but only when their BackColor's has the same color as the previous BackColorSelectedTab setting.

	TabPic16 is used for 96 DPI, TabPic20 for 120 DPI and TabPic24 for 144 DPI. Others DPI setting are handled automatically.
	The application need to have a manifest file to declare it as DPI aware.
	When these pictures are set, the TabPicture property is ignored.
	They can be accessed at design time through a property page.


TabPic24 property:
	Type: Picture
	
	Additional parameter(s):
	    In	Required	Index	As	Long
	Returns or sets the bitmap to be displayed on the tab specified by the Index parameter, when the application is DPI aware.
	TabPic16 is used for 96 DPI, TabPic20 for 120 DPI and TabPic24 for 144 DPI. Others DPI setting are handled automatically.
	The application need to have a manifest file to declare it as DPI aware.
	When these pictures are set, the TabPicture property is ignored.
	They can be accessed at design time through a property page.


TabPicture property:
	Type: Picture
	
	Additional parameter(s):
	    In	Required	Index	As	Long
	Returns or sets the bitmap or icon to display on the tab specified by the Index argument.


Tabs property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the total number of tabs.


TabsEndFreeSpace property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the size of an optional free space after the last tab (for top-otiented tabs that is the rightmost tab).


TabSeparation property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the number of pixels of separation between tabs. The value must be between 0 (zero) and 20.
	When the control has Windows visual styles (Windows "theme"), values less than two pixels are ignored, since the themed tabs have two pixels of separation by design.


TabsPerRow property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the number of tabs for each row.
	If TabWidthStyle property setting is other than ntTWFixed or ntTWTabCaptionWidth, this setting has no effect. If TabWidthStyle property is set to Auto, it has effect only for styles ssStyleTabbedDialog and ssStylePropertyPage.


TabTag property:
	Type: String
	
	Additional parameter(s):
	    In	Required	Index	As	Long
	Similar to a Tag property, but for each tab. You can store any string there. If the tabs are reordered, it will keep this data for this tab.


TabToolTipText property:
	Type: String
	
	Additional parameter(s):
	    In	Required	Index	As	Long
	Returns or sets the text that will be shown as tooltip text when the mouse pointer is over the tab identified by the Index parameter.
	If the tab has not a TabToolTipText set, it will show the control ToolTipText, if there is any text set on that property.


TabTransition property:
	Type: NTTabTransitionConstants
	Returns or sets a value that determines whether the transition between tabs will be with an effect that smooths the transition (and its speed).


TabVisible property:
	Type: Boolean
	
	Additional parameter(s):
	    In	Required	Index	As	Long
	Returns or sets a value that determines whether the tab identified by the Index will be visible.


TabWidthStyle property:
	Type: NTTabWidthStyleConstants
	Returns or sets a value that determines the justification or width of the tabs.
	
	ntTWFixed: All tabs have the same width. If TabMaxWidth is 0 (zero), the tab width will be the available space / TabsPerRow. If TabMaxWidth is greater than 0 (zero), that setting will determine the tabs width.
	
	ntTWTabCaptionWidth: The width of the tabs will be determined by the size of the caption + the size of the tab picture (if any). TabMinWidth and TabMaxWidth settings can set a boundary for the width that a tab can have. Unlike the original SSTab control, if the sum of the widths of all the tabs in a row exceeds the available space, the widths of the tabs in that row are shrunken to fit in the available space.
	
	ntTWTabStripEmulation: Same as ntTWTabCaptionWidth but if the control is not wide enough to show all the tabs, it starts a new row.
	If the control needs to distribute the tabs in more than one row because there is not enough space to fit them all in one row, it will do so by distributing them evenly on the rows. The width of each tab will be increased so that each row of tabs spans the width of the control. 
	But if all the tabs fit in one row, the tabs are not justified (it works the same as ntTWTabCaptionWidth).
	
	ntTWStretchToFill: same as ntTWTabStripEmulation but when there is only one row, if the captions are not wide enough to fill the row, they are stretched to do so.
	
	ntTWTabCaptionWidthFillRows: it works as ntTWTabStripEmulation but if one row is not enough to accomodate all the tabs, it starts a new row but does not distribute all the tabs evenly between rows as ntTWStretchToFill does. So it can show 8 tabs in one row and 1 tab in another row.
	
	ntTWAuto: The behavior is defined by the Style and TDIMode property settings, in this way:
	TDIMode <> <i>ntTDIModeNone</i>: ntTWTabCaptionWidthFillRows
	<i>ssStyleTabbedDialog</i>: ntTWFixed
	<i>ssStylePropertyPage</i>: ntTWTabCaptionWidth
	<i>ntStyleTabStrip</i>: ntTWTabStripEmulation
	<i>ntStyleFlat</i>: ntTWStretchToFill
	<i>ntStyleWindows</i>: ntTWStretchToFill
	
	Note: if the TabOrientation property is set to ntTabOrientationLeftHorizontal or ntTabOrientationRightHorizontal this property has no effect since the tab widths are defined by the widest tab caption. The minimal height is defined by the TabHeight property.
	Also TabMinWidth and TabMaxWidth property settings can be used to set the minimun and maximun tabs size for those orientations.


Tag property:
	Type: String
	Returns or sets an expression that stores any extra data needed for your program.


TDIMode property:
	Type: NTTDIModeConstants
	Returns/sets a value that determines if the control will be used for TDI (tabbed document interface) and which mode (controls or forms). The control behavior changes significantly in this mode because some things are automated.
	
	ntTDIModeControls: Each tab is a "document". Add controls in the tab 0, all control arrays with index 0. For each new tab the controls will replicate. Add also the business code that your program needs to work.
	
	ntTDIModeForms: Add the tab control to the main form, resize the tab control to fit the form, and all the other forms should work automatically.
	It is like an MDI form, but tabbed, that's why it is called 'TDI'. 
	
	MDI stands for Multiple Documents Interface.
	SDI stands for Single Document Interface.
	TDI is Tabbed Document Interface.


Theme property:
	Type: String
	Returns or sets a value in string format that determines a set of property settings with a name, called "theme".


Themes property:
	Type: NewTabThemes (Read only)
	Returns a collection of NewTabTheme objects. They basically provide the names of the themes that are available (and you can set in the Theme property).

	Returns or sets a the tool tip text to be displayed when the mouse is over the control.


Top property:
	Type: Single
	Returns or sets the distance between the internal top edge of the control and the top edge of its container.


UseMaskColor property:
	Type: Boolean

Visible property:
	Type: Boolean
	Returns or sets a value indicating whether the control is visible or hidden.


VisibleTabs property:
	Type: Long (Read only)
	Returns the numbers of tabs that are visible. [TabVisible(Index) = True].


WhatsThisHelpID property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets an associated context number for the control.


Width property:
	Type: Single
	Returns or sets the width of the control.


WordWrap property:
	Type: Boolean
	Returns or sets a value that determines how the control displays the text on each tab.
	In a control that its size and/or the tab texts change dinamically, to make sure that text will not be truncated if it is too long, set the WordWrap property to True, the TabMaxWidth property to 0, and the TabHeight property to a height that allows to view the longest piece of text.
